# rock-paper-scissors
Originally rock-paper-scissors only, but then I remember a Big Bang Theory episode where Sheldon introduces an innovated game of rock-paper-scissors. 

Eventually, I refactored the code and added two more choices for players and computer with the updated score system, first to ten.

I learned a lot through this project and these lessons are the main keypoints:
  -DOM Manipulation
  -Functions
  -Conditional Statements 
  -Randomize Choices in an array
